# GoDBMS

GoDBMS is a simple database management system that is completely written in Go. It is built on top of a B-tree based key-value store. This project is developed using the "Build Your Own Database From Scratch in Go"  as guide, which can be found at [Build Your Own Database](https://build-your-own.org/database/).
